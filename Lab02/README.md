Counting Characters with Loops and Switch Statement

The file CountChars.java at the end of this document contains a template of a program to read in a string
(a sentence or phrase) and count the number of blank spaces, each vowel (a, e, i, o, u in lower case or
upper case), consonants (lower case or upper case) and the rest in the string. It needs a loop to go
through the string character by character and count the characters separately. Since we know how many
characters there are (the length of the string) we can use a for loop controlled by a counter.
